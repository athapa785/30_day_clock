              "'Chapter 10 Introduction to quantum mechanics David Morin, morin@physics.harvard.edu This chapter gives a brief introduction to quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics can be thought of roughly as the study of physics on very small length scales, although there are also certain macroscopic systems it directly applies to. The descriptor \\\\quantum\" arises because in contrast with classical mechanics, certain quantities take on only discrete values. However, some quantities still take on continuous values, as we\\'ll see. In quantum mechanics, particles have wavelike properties, and a particular wave equa- tion, the Schrodinger equation , governs how these waves behave. The Schrodinger equation is di®erent in a few ways from the other wave equations we\\'ve seen in this book. But these di®erences won\\'t keep us from applying all of our usual strategies for solving a wave equation and dealing with the resulting solutions. In some respect, quantum mechanics is just another example of a system governed by a wave equation. In fact, we will ¯nd below that some quantum mechanical systems have exact analogies to systems we\\'ve already studied in this book. So the results can be carried over, with no modi¯cations whatsoever needed. However, although it is fairly straightforward to deal with the actual waves, there are many things about quantum mechanics that are a combination of subtle, perplexing, and bizarre. To name a few: the measurement problem, hidden variables along with Bell\\'s theorem, and wave-particle duality. You\\'ll learn all about these in an actual course on quantum mechanics. Even though there are many things that are highly confusing about quantum mechanics, the nice thing is that it\\'s relatively easy to apply quantum mechanics to a physical system to ¯gure out how it behaves. There is fortunately no need to understand all of the subtleties about quantum mechanics in order to use it. Of course, in most cases this isn\\'t the best strategy to take; it\\'s usually not a good idea to blindly forge ahead with something if you don\\'t understand what you\\'re actually working with. But this lack of understanding can be forgiven in the case of quantum mechanics, because no one really understands it. (Well, maybe a couple people do, but they\\'re few and far between.) If the world waited to use quantum mechanics until it understood it, then we\\'d be stuck back in the 1920\\'s. The bottom line is that quantum mechanics can be used to make predictions that are consistent with experiment. It hasn\\'t failed us yet. So it would be foolish not to use it. The main purpose of this chapter is to demonstrate how similar certain results in quan- tum mechanics are to earlier results we\\'ve derived in the book. You actually know a good 12 CHAPTER 10. INTRODUCTION TO QUANTUM MECHANICS deal of quantum mechanics already, whether you realize it or not. The outline of this chapter is as follows. In Section 10.1 we give a brief history of the development of quantum mechanics. In Section 10.2 we write down, after some motivation, theSchrodinger wave equation , both the time-dependent and time-independent forms. In Section 10.3 we discuss a number of examples. The most important thing to take away from this section is that all of the examples we discuss have exact analogies in the string/spring systems earlier in the book. So we technically won\\'t have to solve anything new here. All the work has been done before. The only thing new that we\\'ll have to do is interpret the old results. In Section 10.4 we discuss the uncertainty principle . As in Section 10.3, we\\'ll ¯nd that we already did the necessary work earlier in the book. The uncertainty principle turns out to be a direct consequence of a result from Fourier analysis. But the interpretation of this result as an uncertainty principle has profound implications in quantum mechanics. 10.1 A brief history Before discussing the Schrodinger wave equation, let\\'s take a brief (and by no means com- prehensive) look at the historical timeline of how quantum mechanics came about. The actual history is of course never as clean as an outline like this suggests, but we can at least get a general idea of how things proceeded. 1900 (Planck): Max Planck proposed that light with frequency ºis emitted in quantized lumps of energy that come in integral multiples of the quantity, E=hº= ¹h! (1) where h¼6:63¢10¡34J¢s isPlanck\\'s constant , and ¹ h´h=2¼= 1:06¢10¡34J¢s. The frequency ºof light is generally very large (on the order of 1015s¡1for the visible spectrum), but the smallness of hwins out, so the hºunit of energy is very small (at least on an everyday energy scale). The energy is therefore essentially continuous for most purposes. However, a puzzle in late 19th-century physics was the blackbody radiation problem. In a nutshell, the issue was that the classical (continuous) theory of light predicted that certain objects would radiate an in¯nite amount of energy, which of course can\\'t be correct. Planck\\'s hypothesis of quantized radiation not only got rid of the problem of the in¯nity, but also correctly predicted the shape of the power curve as a function of temperature. The results that we derived for electromagnetic waves in Chapter 8 are still true. In particular, the energy °ux is given by the Poynting vector in Eq. 8.47. And E=pcfor a light. Planck\\'s hypothesis simply adds the information of how many lumps of energy a wave contains. Although strictly speaking, Planck initially thought that the quantization was only a function of the emission process and not inherent to the light itself. 1905 (Einstein): Albert Einstein stated that the quantization was in fact inherent to the light, and that the lumps can be interpreted as particles, which we now call \\\\photons.\" This proposal was a result of his work on the photoelectric e®ect , which deals with the absorption of light and the emission of elections from a material. We know from Chapter 8 that E=pcfor a light wave. (This relation also follows from Einstein\\'s 1905 work on relativity, where he showed that E=pcfor any massless particle, an example of which is a photon.) And we also know that !=ckfor a light wave. So Planck\\'s E= ¹h!relation becomes E= ¹h! =)pc= ¹h(ck) =) p= ¹hk (2) This result relates the momentum of a photon to the wavenumber of the wave it is associated with.10.1. A BRIEF HISTORY 3 1913 (Bohr): Niels Bohr stated that electrons in atoms have wavelike properties. This correctly explained a few things about hydrogen, in particular the quantized energy levels that were known. 1924 (de Broglie): Louis de Broglie proposed that allparticles are associated with waves, where the frequency and wavenumber of the wave are given by the same relations we found above for photons, namely E= ¹h!andp= ¹hk. The larger Eandpare, the larger ! andkare. Even for small Eandpthat are typical of a photon, !andkare very large because ¹ his so small. So any everyday-sized particle with large (in comparison) energy and momentum values will have extremely large !andkvalues. This (among other reasons) makes it virtually impossible to observe the wave nature of macroscopic amounts of matter. This proposal (that E= ¹h!andp= ¹hkalso hold for massive particles) was a big step, because many things that are true for photons are nottrue for massive (and nonrelativistic) particles. For example, E=pc(and hence !=ck) holds only for massless particles (we\\'ll see below how !andkare related for massive particles). But the proposal was a reasonable one to try. And it turned out to be correct, in view of the fact that the resulting predictions agree with experiments. The fact that any particle has a wave associated with it leads to the so-called wave- particle duality . Are things particles, or waves, or both? Well, it depends what you\\'re doing with them. Sometimes things behave like waves, sometimes they behave like particles. A vaguely true statement is that things behave like waves until a measurement takes place, at which point they behave like particles. However, approximately one million things are left unaddressed in that sentence. The wave-particle duality is one of the things that few people, if any, understand about quantum mechanics. 1925 (Heisenberg): Werner Heisenberg formulated a version of quantum mechanics that made use of matrix mechanics . We won\\'t deal with this matrix formulation (it\\'s rather di±cult), but instead with the following wave formulation due to Schrodinger (this is a waves book, after all). 1926 (Schrodinger): Erwin Schrodinger formulated a version of quantum mechanics that was based on waves. He wrote down a wave equation (the so-called Schrodinger equation ) that governs how the waves evolve in space and time. We\\'ll deal with this equation in depth below. Even though the equation is correct, the correct interpretation of what the wave actually meant was still missing. Initially Schrodinger thought (incorrectly) that the wave represented the charge density. 1926 (Born): Max Born correctly interpreted Schrodinger\\'s wave as a probability am- plitude. By \\\\amplitude\" we mean that the wave must be squared to obtain the desired probability. More precisely, since the wave (as we\\'ll see) is in general complex, we need to square its absolute value. This yields the probability of ¯nding a particle at a given location (assuming that the wave is written as a function of x). This probability isn\\'t a consequence of ignorance, as is the case with virtually every other example of probability you\\'re familiar with. For example, in a coin toss, if you know everything about the initial motion of the coin (velocity, angular velocity), along with all external in°uences (air currents, nature of the °oor it lands on, etc.), then you can predict which side will land facing up. Quantum mechanical probabilities aren\\'t like this. They aren\\'t a consequence of missing information. The probabilities are truly random, and there is no further information (so-called \\\\hidden variables\") that will make things un- random. The topic of hidden variables includes various theorems (such as Bell\\'s theorem) and experimental results that you will learn about in a quantum mechanics course.4 CHAPTER 10. INTRODUCTION TO QUANTUM MECHANICS 1926 (Dirac): Paul Dirac showed that Heisenberg\\'s and Schrodinger\\'s versions of quantum mechanics were equivalent, in that they could both be derived from a more general version of quantum mechanics. 10.2 The Schrodinger equation In this section we\\'ll give a \\\\derivation\" of the Schrodinger equation. Our starting point will be the classical nonrelativistic expression for the energy of a particle, which is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies. We\\'ll assume as usual that the potential is a function of only x. We have E=K+V=1 2mv2+V(x) =p2 2m+V(x): (3) We\\'ll now invoke de Broglie\\'s claim that all particles can be represented as waves with frequency !and wavenumber k, and that E= ¹h!andp= ¹hk. This turns the expression for the energy into ¹h!=¹h2k2 2m+V(x): (4) A wave with frequency !and wavenumber kcan be written as usual as Ã(x; t) =Aei(kx¡!t) (the convention is to put a minus sign in front of the !t). In 3-D we would have Ã(r; t) = Aei(k¢r¡!t), but let\\'s just deal with 1-D. We now note that @Ã @t=¡i!Ã =) !Ã=i@Ã @t; and @2Ã @x2=¡k2Ã=) k2Ã=¡@2Ã @x2: (5) If we multiply the energy equation in Eq. (4) by Ã, and then plug in these relations, we obtain ¹h(!Ã) =¹h2 2m(k2Ã) +V(x)Ã=) i¹h@Ã @t=¡¹h2 2m¢@2Ã @x2+V Ã (6) This is the time-dependent Schrodinger equation . If we put the xandtarguments back in, the equation takes the form, i¹h@Ã(x; t) @t=¡¹h2 2m¢@2Ã(x; t) @x2+V(x)Ã(x; t): (7) In 3-D, the xdependence turns into dependence on all three coordinates ( x; y; z ), and the @2Ã=@x2term becomes r2Ã(the sum of the second derivatives). Remember that Born\\'s (correct) interpretation of Ã(x) is that jÃ(x)j2gives the probability of ¯nding the particle at position x. Having successfully produced the time-dependent Schrodinger equation, we should ask: Did the above reasoning actually prove that the Schrodinger equation is valid? No, it didn\\'t, for three reasons. 1. The reasoning is based on de Broglie\\'s assumption that there is a wave associated with every particle, and also on the assumption that the !andkof the wave are related to Eandpvia Planck\\'s constant in Eqs. (1) and (2). We had to accept these assumptions on faith. 2. Said in a di®erent way, it is impossible to actually prove anything in physics. All we can do is make an educated guess at a theory, and then do experiments to try to show10.2. THE SCHRODINGER EQUATION 5 that the theory is consistent with the real world. The more experiments we do, the more comfortable we are that the theory is a good one. But we can never be absolutely sure that we have the correct theory. In fact, odds are that it\\'s simply the limiting case of a more correct theory. 3. The Schrodinger equation actually isn\\'t valid, so there\\'s certainly no way that we proved it. Consistent with the above point concerning limiting cases, the quantum theory based on Schrodinger\\'s equation is just a limiting theory of a more correct one, which happens to be quantum ¯eld theory (which uni¯es quantum mechanics with special relativity). This is turn must be a limiting theory of yet another more correct one, because it doesn\\'t incorporate gravity. Eventually there will be one theory that covers everything (although this point can be debated), but we\\'re de¯nitely not there yet. Due to the \\\\ i\" that appears in Eq. (6), Ã(x) is complex. And in contrast with waves in classical mechanics, the entire complex function now matters in quantum mechanics. We won\\'t be taking the real part in the end. Up to this point in the book, the use of complex functions was simply a matter of convenience, because it is easier to work with exponentials than trig functions. Only the real part mattered (or imaginary part { take your pick, but not both). But in quantum mechanics the whole complex wavefunction is relevant. However, the theory is structured in such a way that anything you might want to measure (position, momentum, energy, etc.) will always turn out to be a real quantity. This is a necessary feature of any valid theory, of course, because you\\'re not going to go out and measure a distance of 2 + 5 imeters, or pay an electrical bill of 17 + 6 ikilowatt hours. As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, there is an endless number of di±cult questions about quantum mechanics that can be discussed. But in this short introduction to the subject, let\\'s just accept Schrodinger\\'s equation as valid, and see where it takes us. Solving the equation If we put aside the profound implications of the Schrodinger equation and regard it as simply a mathematical equation, then it\\'s just another wave equation. We already know the solution, of course, because we used the function Ã(x; t) =Aei(kx¡!t)to produce Eqs. (5) and (6) in the ¯rst place. But let\\'s pretend that we don\\'t know this, and let\\'s solve the Schrodinger equation as if we were given it out of the blue. As always, we\\'ll guess an exponential solution. If we ¯rst look at exponential behavior in the time coordinate, our guess is Ã(x; t) =e¡i!tf(x) (the minus sign here is convention). Plugging this into Eq. (7) and canceling the e¡i!tyields ¹h!f(x) =¡¹h2 2m@2f(x) @x2+V(x)f(x): (8) But from Eq. (1), we have ¹ h!=E. And we\\'ll now replace f(x) with Ã(x). This might cause a little confusion, since we\\'ve already used Ãto denote the entire wavefunction Ã(x; t). However, it is general convention to also use the letter Ãto denote the spatial part. So we now have E Ã(x) =¡¹h2 2m@2Ã(x) @x2+V(x)Ã(x) (9) This is called the time-independent Schrodinger equation . This equation is more restrictive than the original time- dependent Schrodinger equation, because it assumes that the parti- cle/wave has a de¯nite energy (that is, a de¯nite !). In general, a particle can be in a state that is the superposition of states with various de¯nite energies, just like the motion of a6 CHAPTER 10. INTRODUCTION TO QUANTUM MECHANICS string can be the superposition of various normal modes with de¯nite !\\'s. The same rea- soning applies here as with all the other waves we\\'ve discussed: From Fourier analysis and from the linearity of the Schrodinger equation, we can build up any general wavefunction from ones with speci¯c energies. Because of this, it su±ces to consider the time-independent Schrodinger equation. The solutions for that equation form a basis for all possible solutions.1 Continuing with our standard strategy of guessing exponentials, we\\'ll let Ã(x) =Aeikx. Plugging this into Eq. (9) and canceling the eikxgives (going back to the ¹ h!instead of E) ¹h!=¡¹h2 2m(¡k2) +V(x) =)¹h!=¹h2k2 2m+V(x): (10) This is simply Eq. (4), so we\\'ve ended up back where we started, as expected. However, our goal here was to show how the Schrodinger equation can be solved from scratch, without knowing where it came from. Eq. (10) is (sort of) a dispersion relation. If V(x) is a constant Cin a given region, then the relation between !andk(namely != ¹hk2=2m+C) is independent of x, so we have a nice sinusoidal wavefunction (or exponential, if kis imaginary). However, if V(x) isn\\'t constant, then the wavefunction isn\\'t characterized by a unique wavenumber. So a function of the form eikxdoesn\\'t work as a solution for Ã(x). (A Fourier superposition can certainly work, since any function can be expressed that way, but a single eikxby itself doesn\\'t work.) This is similar to the case where the density of a string isn\\'t constant. We don\\'t obtain sinusoidal waves there either. 10.3 Examples In order to solve for the wavefunction Ã(x) in the time-independent Schrodinger equation in Eq. (9), we need to be given the potential energy V(x). So let\\'s now do some examples with particular functions V(x). 10.3.1 Constant potential The simplest example is where we have a constant potential, V(x) =V0in a given region. Plugging Ã(x) =Aeikxinto Eq. (9) then gives E=¹h2k2 2m+V0=)k=s 2m(E¡V0) ¹h2: (11) (We\\'ve taken the positive square root here. We\\'ll throw in the minus sign by hand to obtain the other solution, in the discussion below.) kis a constant, and its real/imaginary nature depends on the relation between EandV0. IfE > V 0, then kis real, so we have oscillatory solutions, Ã(x) =Aeikx+Be¡ikx: (12) But if E < V 0, then kis imaginary, so we have exponentially growing or decaying solutions. If we let ·´ jkj=p 2m(V0¡E)=¹h, then Ã(x) takes the form, Ã(x) =Ae·x+Ba¡·x: (13) We see that it is possible for Ã(x) to be nonzero in a region where E < V 0. Since Ã(x) is the probability amplitude, this implies that it is possible to have a particle with E < V 0. 1The \\\\time-dependent\" and \\\\time-independent\" quali¯ers are a bit of a pain to keep saying, so we usually just say \\\\the Schrodinger equation,\" and it\\'s generally clear from the context which one we mean.10.3. EXAMPLES 7 This isn\\'t possible classically, and it is one of the many ways in which quantum mechanics diverges from classical mechanics. We\\'ll talk more about this when we discuss the ¯nite square well in Section 10.3.3. IfE=V0, then this is the one case where the strategy of guessing an exponential function doesn\\'t work. But if we go back to Eq. (9) we see that E=V0implies @2Ã=@x2= 0, which in turn implies that Ãis a linear function, Ã(x) =Ax+B: (14) In all of these cases, the full wavefunction (including the time dependence) for a particle with a speci¯c value of Eis given by Ã(x; t) =e¡i!tÃ(x) =e¡iEt=¹hÃ(x) (15) Again, we\\'re using the letter Ãto stand for two di®erent functions here, but the meaning of each is clear from the number of arguments. Any general wavefunction is built up from a superposition of the states in Eq. (15) with di®erent values of E, just as the general motion of a string is built of from various normal modes with di®erent frequencies !. The fact that a particle can be in a superposition of states with di®erent energies is another instance '"
